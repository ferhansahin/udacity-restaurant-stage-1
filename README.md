# Restaurant Reviews App
---
## Overview

For the Restaurant Reviews projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. 

## Specification

You have been provided with the code for a restaurant reviews website. Your job is to update the code to resolve the issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

## How to run the project

To run the project, download or clone the repository in your computer:

$ git clone 

and follow the instructions below:

In the repository folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal (like Git Bash, Cygwin or the Windows terminal), check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000 or python -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000. You can now see the live site.
